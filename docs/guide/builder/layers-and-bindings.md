# Layers & bindings

A keymap is a stack of **layers**, and each layer assigns a **binding** (an
action) to every physical key. Layers share the same geometry and matrix — only
the bindings differ.

The **Layers** panel (layer list with `L0`/`L1` badges) and the binding picker
open at the bottom.

## Layers panel

The **Layers** section lists every layer with its name and an `L{index}` badge.

- **Click** a layer to select it — the canvas then edits that layer's bindings.
- **Add layer** — appends a layer (bindings start transparent / pass-through).
- The per-layer **⋮** menu has **Rename**, **Duplicate**, **Delete** (Delete is
  disabled when only one layer remains). Double-click a name to rename inline.

Layer order matters: a `transparent` binding falls through to the layer **below**,
and bindings reference layers **by name** (a layer-tap targets `"raise"`, not an
index).

```json
"layers": [
  { "name": "base",  "bindings": [ /* … */ ] },
  { "name": "lower", "bindings": [ /* … */ ] },
  { "name": "raise", "bindings": [ /* … */ ] }
]
```

## The binding picker

Select a key and click **Edit binding** (or a slot in the inspector) to open the
picker. Its header chip shows the context, e.g.
`base · Key #5 · A` — layer, key index, slot, and current binding. A firmware
chip (e.g. `QMK + VIA`, with a USB/Bluetooth icon) shows which targets the picker
is offering actions for; **Close picker** dismisses it.

The picker is **firmware-aware** — it only offers actions the selected target(s)
support and warns when one is unsupported.

## Bindings, in the config

Each layer's `bindings` array has one [action](/reference/config/actions) per
key, in `keyboard.keys` order. You can write the **friendly shorthand** and the
app expands it:

```json
"bindings": [
  "Q", "W", "E", "R", "T",
  { "type": "mod_tap", "tap": "A", "mod": "LEFT_GUI" },
  "Ctrl+C",
  { "type": "layer_tap", "tap": "SPACE", "layer": "raise", "resolve": "prefer-hold" },
  { "type": "transparent" }
]
```

| You assign…                   | Examples                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A keycode                     | `"Q"`, `"SPACE"`, `"Volume Up"`                                           |
| A modified key (combo string) | `"Ctrl+C"`, `"Ctrl+Shift+4"`                                              |
| Tap-hold presets              | `mod_tap` (hold = modifier), `layer_tap` (hold = layer)                   |
| Layer switch                  | `{ "type": "layer", "mode": "momentary", "layer": "lower" }`              |
| Special                       | `caps_word`, `sticky_key`, `transparent`, `none`, output, lighting, mouse |
| References                    | `macro`, `tap_dance`, `mod_morph`, `hold_tap` (defined at the top level)  |

The complete catalog — every action, its fields, and firmware support — is in the
[Actions reference](/reference/config/actions).

## Encoders & sliders

A key tagged **Encoder** carries `cw` / `ccw` / `press` bindings per layer; a
**Slider** carries an analog value-map. You assign these from the
[inspector](/guide/builder/inspector#binding). In the config they live on the
layer:

```json
{
    "name": "base",
    "bindings": [
        /* … */
    ],
    "encoders": [{ "cw": "Volume Up", "ccw": "Volume Down" }]
}
```

## It is all one config

Whatever you assign is written into the same
[JSON config](/reference/config/keymap-format) the **Edit JSON** panel shows — so
you can build visually and read the JSON back, or paste a whole layer of bindings
and watch the canvas update.
