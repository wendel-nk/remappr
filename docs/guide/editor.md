# The keymap editor

The keymap editor is where you assign bindings against a **device** — a real
connected keyboard, or a simulated one. It is the surface you land on after
[connecting hardware](/guide/app/connecting), and where the builder hands off
when you click **Editor**.

The editor: the **LAYERS** sidebar, the keyboard in the centre, the header
toolbar, and the binding inspector on the right.

## Header toolbar

Left → right (each button shows the tooltip in quotes; many are
**capability-gated** — hidden or disabled unless the connected firmware supports
them):

See [Advanced features](/guide/app/advanced) for Macros, Tap Dance, Combos, Key
Overrides, Wireless and Advanced Mode.

## Layers

The **LAYERS** sidebar lists layers with an accent dot and an `L0`/`L1` badge.

- **Click** to select; the keyboard shows that layer.
- **+** (**Add Layer**) appends a layer.
- The per-layer **⋮** menu: **Rename** (opens the _"New Layer Name"_ dialog),
  **Duplicate**, **Delete** (disabled when it is the only layer).
- **Drag** the grip handle (_"Drag to reorder"_) to reorder layers.

## Editing a binding

Click a key → the **Inspector** shows the key (a tinted cap preview + its
category and layer) with the binding picker. Closing the picker keeps the key
selected (a floating card with an **Edit** button stays); **Esc** clears the
selection entirely.

- **Empty state:** _"Select a key to edit its action."_
- **Encoders:** the inspector reads/writes CW and CCW separately
  (_"Encoder {slot} — CW/CCW"_).
- **Tap-dance:** when the device supports dynamic entries, an _"Edit tap-dance
  #{n}…"_ button opens the tap-dance editor.

Every change writes to the device immediately and is **undoable**; nothing is
permanent until you **Save**.

## Heatmap, Live view & Key test

These overlay the keyboard:

- **Heatmap** — colours keys by press count, with a _Less → More_ legend and a
  **Reset press counts** button; _"View load stats"_ opens the stats modal.
- **Live view** — lights keys as you press them.
- **Key test** — _"Press every key"_ with a `{seen} / {total}` counter and a
  **Reset key test** button. The status line reads **Hardware matrix** (reading
  the switch matrix over the wire) or **OS events** (fallback via OS key events —
  focus-dependent, misses non-emitting keys).

## Editor vs builder

|        | Builder                                      | Editor                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Target | A design (no hardware needed)                | A device (real or simulated)                |
| Edits  | Layout, matrix, controller, layers, bindings | Bindings, device settings, per-key RGB      |
| Output | Exported firmware project                    | Live changes on the device (Save to commit) |

Both read and write the same [JSON keymap config](/reference/config/overview).
