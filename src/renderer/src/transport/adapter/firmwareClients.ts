//
// Each `@firmware/<client>/index.ts` runs `registerAdapter()` as an import side
// effect. We used to list those imports by hand in main.tsx; instead we glob
// them so a new client dir is picked up with zero wiring. `import.meta.glob`
// (without `eager`) also code-splits every client into its own chunk, so they
// load on demand at connect time rather than bloating the initial bundle.
//
// Load order is intentionally NOT relied upon: see ./discovery.ts, which sorts
// adapters by an explicit priority so Remappr's HID filter still wins the
// single-filter Electron discovery regardless of which chunk resolves first.

// `src/firmware` also holds non-adapter support modules that ship their own
// index.ts (catalog = pure data, config = keymap compilers). Importing those
// here would be wrong — config would eagerly register every compiler at connect
// time. They are the only two such dirs; everything else matched below is a
// client. A new non-adapter dir with an index.ts must be added here.
